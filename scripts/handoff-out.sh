# Hand off "active host" status FROM this host. Stops services, runs a
# final sync to capture any drift, clears ACTIVE_HOST, commits + pushes.
#
# After this completes, the repo says "no host is active right now."
# Run handoff-in.sh on the host you're activating next.
#
# Refuses to run unless this host is currently the active one. Use
# handoff-in.sh --force on the OTHER host if the active host has died
# and can't be reached.
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Verify ACTIVE_HOST names this host.
#   2. Stop hermes services (gateway, dashboard, hindsight-server) and
#      any sidekick units that exist (sidekick, sidekick-audio,
#      whatsapp-bridge).
#   3. Run sync-hindsight-bank.sh to capture the final dump (BEFORE
#      hindsight-server stops so pg0 is still alive — wait, hindsight
#      is already stopped, so we'd want to start, dump, stop. Tricky.
#      Approach: stop OTHER services first, dump while hindsight is
#      still up, then stop hindsight).
#   4. Run sync-hermes-state.sh for the final SQLite sessions/messages dump.
#   5. Run sync-sidekick-db.sh for Sidekick UI/session metadata.
#   6. Run sync-hermes.sh to commit any repo-backed drift.
#   7. Update ACTIVE_HOST to "no host active" with a transition note.
#   8. git add ACTIVE_HOST; git commit; git push.
#
# Pre-emptive sanity: refuses if working tree is dirty (other than
# ACTIVE_HOST itself), to avoid commingling unrelated changes with the
# handoff commit.
