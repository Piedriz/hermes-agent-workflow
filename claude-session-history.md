# claude-session-history.md

You are Claude Code. You just woke up in a `claude-remote` tmux session
on someone's hermes-agent-workflow host. This file is the running
narrative of the project — read it end-to-end before doing anything
else, then acknowledge briefly and tell the user what's on the backlog.

This is **not** a changelog or a tidy doc. It is the warm-start memory
that lets a fresh session pick up where the last one left off.

## What this project is

A claude-code workflow building and maintaining a hermes-agent + sidekick
deployment, powered by:

- **hermes-agent** — the Python agent runtime (skills, memory, gateway)
  living in `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/`, plus its venv at
  `~/.hermes/hermes-venv/`.
- **sidekick** — the PWA front end (React + Bun proxy + Python audio
  bridge) at `~/code/sidekick/`. Public repo:
  `github.com/jscholz/sidekick`.
- **this template** (`hermes-agent-workflow`) — the deployment shell:
  bootstrap script, systemd units, vendored skills, hermes-agent
  patches, and the framework/instance contract that keeps the rebase
  tax low.

The user owns a fork of this repo; framework files (scripts, systemd
unit templates, vendored skills) come from upstream, and instance files
(config, memories, custom skills, secrets) live in their fork.

## Where to look

When you need to orient on something, start here:

- **`AGENTS.md`** — the operating manual for this repo. Framework /
  instance split, first-run flow, file ownership rules. Read it in
  every session.
- **`README.md`** — the user-facing tour. Quickstart, why-fork, the
  symlink pattern, secrets via git-crypt.
- **`scripts/`** — install + maintenance tools.
  - `bootstrap.sh` — first-run wizard.
  - `apply-patches.sh` — replay hermes-agent patches on top of upstream.
  - `update-workflow.sh` — `git pull` + re-apply patches.
  - `doctor.sh` — health checks.
  - `sync-cc-history.sh` — cron-driven snapshot of Claude Code
    transcripts into the repo.
  - `setup-remote-claude.sh` — install the `claude-remote` shell
    function (this file is what `claude-remote` reads on warm start).
- **`skills/`** — what hermes can do. Vendored upstream skills + the
  user's `user-skills/` (if any).
- **`patches/hermes-agent/`** — the local hermes-agent patches in play.
  See `PATCHES.md` for what each one does.
- **`hosts/<host>/`** — per-machine state (Claude Code transcripts,
  memory snapshots).
- **`~/.hermes/`** — instance home. Config, secrets, runtime state.
  Mostly symlinked back into the repo.

## Maintenance rule (read this before editing)

This file is the **warm-start narrative**. Append to it when something
durable happens — events a future session would benefit from knowing:

- Architecture decisions (and their tradeoffs).
- Non-obvious bug root causes (the "took us 3h to find" kind, not the
  one-liner fix).
- Major features that shipped — include the commit SHA + a one-line
  summary. Don't recap the diff, just enough to recognize the milestone.
- Config changes that would surprise someone reading the codebase cold.

What this file is **not**:

- A changelog. Don't write it for tooling, write it for the next agent.
- A diary. Skip routine work and tactical fixes.
- A duplicate of `AGENTS.md` or `PATCHES.md` — link to those, don't
  restate.

Keep entries terse, chronological, **most recent at the bottom**.
Update the "Last updated" line on every meaningful edit. If you're
unsure whether an event qualifies, ask the user.

## Narrative

(no entries yet — this is a fresh deployment of the workflow template)

## Decision log

A brief table for "why we did it this way" entries. Append rows; do
not edit existing ones unless the underlying decision actually changed.

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives considered |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
|      |          |           |                         |
|      |          |           |                         |
|      |          |           |                         |
